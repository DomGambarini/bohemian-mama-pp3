## 5 Planes of UX

**Strategy:** Identify and create detailed user personas based on your target audience, taking into consideration factors like cooking expertise and interest in seasonal, local ingredients. Create a content that aligns with user interests. Plan the distribution of seasonal recipes, cooking tips, and user-generated content to keep the audience engaged.

**Scope:** Design features that enhance the user experience, such as a user-friendly recipe search, develop a mobile friendly website, and an easy to use comment system for users. Also, create a way for users to submit, share, and explore each other's recipes, creating a sense of community and collaboration.

**Structure:** Design a clear site structure that categorises recipes by season, ingredient. Ensure easy navigation to enhance the overall user experience.
Optimize the blog's design for various devices, especially mobile devices, to accommodate users who may access the blog while cooking or on the go.

**Skeleton:** Design a clean and visually appealing interface with a focus on readability, imagery, and ease of use. Incorporate interactive elements like step-by-step recipe guidlines and visually appealing images to enhance the engagement.

**Surface:** Maintain a consistent visual theme, including color schemes and imagery, that reflects the blog's logo and resonates with the target audience.
Implement feedback mechanisms, such as confirmation messages and notifications, to keep users informed about their actions and interactions on the blog.

### Making changes to the website

First you need to sign-up to GitHub and Code Anywhere. To do this please see below.

#### Create a Code Anywhere account

1. If you don't already have one, go to the Code Anywhere website <https://codeanywhere.com/signup> and create a new account.
2. Enter first and last name.
3. Enter Email
4. Enter new password

#### Create a GitHub account

1. If you don't already have one, go to the GitHub website <https://github.com/> and create a new account.

To access the code to this project there are two options: **Cloning** and **Forking**.

Cloning: code will be linked to your repo and any pushes you make will go to the original developer for approval.

#### Here is how to clone code

1. On GitHub.com, navigate to the main page of the repository. You can find that [here](#######################)
2. Above the list of files, click <> **Code**.
3. Copy the URL for the repository.
4. In a separate tab, open Code Anywhere
5. Create a new workspace
6. Type ' git clone ', and then paste the URL you copied earlier.
7. Press Enter to create your local clone.

Forking: refers to creating a personal copy of someone else's repository under your own GitHub account. This copy is stored in your account and allows you to freely experiment with and make changes to the code without affecting the original repository. If I make changes to the original repo you will be informed and have the option to pull.

#### Here is how to fork code

1. Log in to your GitHub account and navigate to the repository you want to fork. You can find that [here](https://github.com/DomGambarini/first-milestone-project)
2. On the repository's page, click on the "Fork" button located at the top right corner of the page. This action creates a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.
3. GitHub will redirect you to the forked repository, which is now hosted under your account. You can identify it by the "forked from" message displayed at the top of the repository name.
4. At this point, you have successfully forked the repository, and you can start working with the code.
