## 5 Planes of UX

**Strategy:** Identify and create detailed user personas based on your target audience, taking into consideration factors like cooking expertise and interest in seasonal, local ingredients. Create a content that aligns with user interests. Plan the distribution of seasonal recipes, cooking tips, and user-generated content to keep the audience engaged.

**Scope:** Design features that enhance the user experience, such as a user-friendly recipe search, develop a mobile friendly website, and an easy to use comment system for users. Also, create a way for users to submit, share, and explore each other's recipes, creating a sense of community and collaboration.

**Structure:** Design a clear site structure that categorises recipes by season, ingredient. Ensure easy navigation to enhance the overall user experience.
Optimize the blog's design for various devices, especially mobile devices, to accommodate users who may access the blog while cooking or on the go.

**Skeleton:** Design a clean and visually appealing interface with a focus on readability, imagery, and ease of use. Incorporate interactive elements like step-by-step recipe guidlines and visually appealing images to enhance the engagement.

**Surface:** Maintain a consistent visual theme, including color schemes and imagery, that reflects the blog's logo and resonates with the target audience.
Implement feedback mechanisms, such as confirmation messages and notifications, to keep users informed about their actions and interactions on the blog.

## Testing

The manual testing procedure involved examining the functions of individual website features. Chrome DevTools facilitated testing across various screen dimensions.

## Bugs Encounted

1. The selectfield input does not have a required attribute and therefore when leaving the field blank it would not display the usual red line.
1. When on the edit page the selectfield, textarea, and url input was not populated with the recipe data.
1. When clicking to expand a recipe the modal would display the incorrect data from another recipe.

## Deployment

### Setting up GitHub pages

1. To add files to the repository take the following steps
1. In the command line type - git add .
   git commit -m "This is being committed" git push
1. To add all new files or modified file use " ." - To add a single file use the pathway to the file eg .index.html or assets/css/style.css When committing make sure your comments are clear about what changes have been made. Pushing will send your work to the repository
1. Any changes made and pushed to the main branch will automatically show up on the site.

### Making changes to the website

First you need to sign-up to GitHub and Code Anywhere. To do this please see below.

#### Create a Code Anywhere account

1. If you don't already have one, go to the Code Anywhere website <https://codeanywhere.com/signup> and create a new account.
2. Enter first and last name.
3. Enter Email
4. Enter new password

#### Create a GitHub account

1. If you don't already have one, go to the GitHub website <https://github.com/> and create a new account.
2. Click sign up
3. Enter email address
4. Enter username
5. Create password
6. Verify your account by solving the puzzles
7. Click create account
8. Verify your account in using your sign-up email

To access the code to this project there are two options: **Cloning** and **Forking**.

Cloning: code will be linked to your repo and any pushes you make will go to the original developer for approval.

#### Here is how to clone code

1. On GitHub.com, navigate to the main page of the repository. You can find that [here](#######################)
2. Above the list of files, click <> **Code**.
3. Copy the URL for the repository.
4. In a separate tab, open Code Anywhere
5. Create a new workspace
6. Type ' git clone ', and then paste the URL you copied earlier.
7. Press Enter to create your local clone.

Forking: refers to creating a personal copy of someone else's repository under your own GitHub account. This copy is stored in your account and allows you to freely experiment with and make changes to the code without affecting the original repository. If I make changes to the original repo you will be informed and have the option to pull.

#### Here is how to fork code

1. Log in to your GitHub account and navigate to the repository you want to fork. You can find that [here](https://github.com/DomGambarini/first-milestone-project)
2. On the repository's page, click on the "Fork" button located at the top right corner of the page. This action creates a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.
3. GitHub will redirect you to the forked repository, which is now hosted under your account. You can identify it by the "forked from" message displayed at the top of the repository name.
4. At this point, you have successfully forked the repository, and you can start working with the code.

#### How to deploy to Heroku with CodeAnywhere

1. Create a new application using the Heroku dashboard.
1. Go to settings tab, click on 'reveal config vars' and add config vars such as IP (0.0.0.0), PORT (5000), MongoDB Name, MongoDB URI (URL with DB name and password).
1. Install Heroku via the console using 'npm install -g heroku'.
1. Log into Heroku via the console using 'heroku login' and follow the on screen instructions to log in.
1. Create a requirements.txt via the console using 'pip3 freeze > requirements.txt'.
1. Create a Procfile via the console using 'echo web: python app.py > Procfile'.
1. Connect GitHub to Heroku via the console using 'heroku git:remote -a bohemian-mama'
1. Commit all files in your project via the console using 'git add .' and 'git commit -m "Message"'.
1. Deploy your project to Heroku via the console using 'git push heroku master'.

#### Running the application locally using CodeAnywhere

1. Clone the repository as described above and upload it to CodeAnywhere.
1. Install the required libraries as specified in the requirements.txt.
1. Set your environment variables by creating env.py file and adding them there.
1. Create a .gitignore file in the root directory and include the env.py file to prevent it being pushed to GitHub.
1. Import the env.py file into the app.py file to access the enivironment variables.
1. Finally, run the application.
