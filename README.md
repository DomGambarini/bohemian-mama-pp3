To access the code to this project there are two options: **Cloning** and **Forking**.

Cloning: code will be linked to your repo and any pushes you make will go to the original developer for approval.

#### Here is how to clone code

1. On GitHub.com, navigate to the main page of the repository. You can find that [here](#######################)
2. Above the list of files, click <> **Code**.
3. Copy the URL for the repository.
4. In a separate tab, open Code Anywhere
5. Create a new workspace
6. Type ' git clone ', and then paste the URL you copied earlier.
7. Press Enter to create your local clone.

Forking: refers to creating a personal copy of someone else's repository under your own GitHub account. This copy is stored in your account and allows you to freely experiment with and make changes to the code without affecting the original repository. If I make changes to the original repo you will be informed and have the option to pull.

#### Here is how to fork code

1. Log in to your GitHub account and navigate to the repository you want to fork. You can find that [here](https://github.com/DomGambarini/first-milestone-project)
2. On the repository's page, click on the "Fork" button located at the top right corner of the page. This action creates a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.
3. GitHub will redirect you to the forked repository, which is now hosted under your account. You can identify it by the "forked from" message displayed at the top of the repository name.
4. At this point, you have successfully forked the repository, and you can start working with the code.
